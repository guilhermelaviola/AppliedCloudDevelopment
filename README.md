# Applied Cloud Development
My school homework from **#DescomplicaDigital** on Applied Cloud Development, which is the practice of designing, building, and running software applications on remote servers (the cloud) instead of local machines, leveraging scalable resources from providers like AWS, Azure, or GCP for flexibility, speed, and cost-efficiency, enabling modern features like AI, data analytics, and seamless user access from anywhere. It involves using cloud-native tools, containers, and services to create solutions for various industries, from finance (Open Banking) to insurance (AI claims processing).
