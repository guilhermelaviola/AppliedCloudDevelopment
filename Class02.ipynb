        "Apache Airflow is an open-source platform widely used for orchestrating and monitoring data workflows through DAGs that define task order and dependencies. Its core functionality is built around operators that execute specific actions, hooks that enable seamless connections to external systems, and XCom for data exchange between tasks. With support for linear, parallel, and conditional execution flows, Airflow offers a flexible and robust framework for building dynamic, scalable, and efficient data pipelines in modern data environments."
