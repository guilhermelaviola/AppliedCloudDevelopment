        "# **Airflow & Machine Learning**\n",
        "MLOps, inspired by DevOps, streamlines and automates the lifecycle of machine learning models, from training to deployment and retraining. Apache Airflow plays a key role in orchestrating these pipelines, enabling automated model training, evaluation, deployment, and continuous monitoring. By leveraging Airflow, teams can implement scheduled or condition-triggered retraining, manage complex workflows, and maintain a history of metrics to ensure only the best-performing models reach production. This approach enhances efficiency, ensures model reliability, and aligns ML efforts with business objectives, allowing organizations to maximize the value of their machine learning investments."
